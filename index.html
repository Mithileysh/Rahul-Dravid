      <p class="text-center"><b>Rahul Sharad Dravid, "The Wall", former Indian cricketer and captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket and probably one of the last classical Test match batsmen.</b></p>
      <p>Rahul Dravid batted exactly like the person he is: stately and upright, dignity and poise his two shoulders, standing up to everything coming at him with minimum fuss. He picked his shots carefully, almost like he was weighing the risk for fear of letting himself and his side down. There was little about him that was flamboyant - there isn't with an oak - and patiently, brick by brick, he built giant edifices. He is a good man and he batted like a good man. </p>
      <p>It was but a feather that prevented him from getting a century on debut at Lord's. He would have liked it, for he has this sense of history about him. He would have wanted to be on that honours board, and 15 years later he inscribed his name there with a Dravid special. Every time Rahul Dravid found a glitch in his batting, he did everything he could to correct it. Even when it required superhuman effort.
      <p>Dravid, in his classic self-effacing way, had confessed to being, for most part, an on-side player. The bowlers had come to know of his strengths and had stopped feeding him on his legs. He had to find another way to score runs, he admitted. Which was how he became one of cricket's outstanding off-side batsmen.He was restrained in celebration, just as he was restrained in disappointment - exactly as the true gentleman should be. And yet his emotional self-control co-existed with fierce competitiveness and national pride. </p>

        Career In a Glance
      </h2>
      <p>

He made his ODI and Test debuts in 1996, but while he struggled in ODIs initially, he scored a flawless 95 on Test debut an innings that was eclipsed by a century from fellow debutant Sourav Ganguly.
His initial performances in both forms of the game set the tone for his first few years in international cricket. While he grew in stature and confidence on the Test arena, he struggled in the limited-overs format, before being dropped from the team.
However, the tour to New Zealand in 1998-99, saw a changed Dravid come back into the Indian team and establish himself in both formats. He upped his strike rate, learned to rotate the strike and pierce the gaps better, and all the while maintained his impregnable defence that gave rise to his famous nickname 'The Wall'.
To illustrate with numbers how Dravid changed his one-day game, from his debut in 1996 till the end of 1998 he played in 65 matches, scoring 1709 runs at a middling average of 31.64 and a below-par strike rate of 63.48.
<p>Since the start of 1999 to the present, he has played in 274 matches scoring 9056 runs with an average of 41.35 and a strike-rate of 72.84. In other words, Dravid raised his average and strike-rate by about ten points each. In thus re-inventing his game, he ensured that India had the services of one of its most accomplished batsmen for both forms of the game.
His Test match form was never under scrutiny and in the years 2002-06, he established himself as the wicket that was most prized by opponents, even ahead of Tendulkar. In that five-year period, Dravid amassed runs at an average of 63.69, scoring buckets of runs in all conditions and against all opposition. He was the single largest factor in India over-turning its abysmal away record, with the result that the team won more matches abroad in the 2000s decade than it had in its entire Test match playing history from 1934 to the end of 1999.</p>
</p><p>
Towards the end of 2007, Dravid went into a form slump, that saw him lose his place in the ODI side, while he hung on to his Test spot by a thin margin. However, he re-emerged from the slump and even made a brief comeback into the ODI side after many had thought his limited-overs career was all but over.
He is among only 5 men with Tendulkar, Ponting, Lara and Kallis being the others to have scored more than 10,000 runs in both ODIs and Test matches.
Dravid had a tremendous tour of England in 2011 scoring three tons, including one at Lord's and aggregated 461 runs in the four tests. A poor Australia tour where he was bowled 6 times in the 8 innings forced him to quit the game. He announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket on 9th March bringing the curtains down on a legendary career.

      <dl class="dl-horizontal timeline ">
        <dt>January 11, 1973</dt>
        <dd>Dravid was born in a Marathi family in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.His family later moved to Bangalore, Karnataka, where he was raised.</dd>
        <dt>1991-March 1996 </dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">Formative Years</dd>
        <dd>On first-class debut against Maharashtra , Dravid makes himself heard by scoring 82. He knocks on the Test doors with 153 in the semi-finals and a double-hundred in the Ranji Trophy final in 1996.
</dd>
        <dt>April 3, 1996</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">International appearance</dd><dd>Dravid makes his one-day debut against Sri Lanka in Singapore, making just 3 in an Indian win.</dd>
        <dt>June 20-24, 1996</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">Distinguished Test debut</dd><dd>An injury to Sanjay Manjrekar gives Dravid his India cap at Lord's five years after his first-class debut. He and Sourav Ganguly then light up the arena with a 94-run partnership. Ganguly scores a memorable hundred, but Dravid misses out by five runs, walking on a thin edge.</dd>
        <dt>January 16-20, 1997</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">Maiden hundred</dd><dd>India enter the bullring for the third Test against South Africa at the Wanderers after being walloped in the first two. Dravid, batting at No.3, settles down after a nervous start and cuts, pulls, and drives his way to a masterclass.</dd>
        <dt>May 21, 1997</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">Maiden ODI hundred in lost cause</dd><dd>In the famous Saeed Anwar match in Chennai, Dravid sustains India with his maiden hundred in ODIs but his dismissal triggers the end. </dd>
        <dt>May 26, 1999</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">Into the record books</dd><dd>Against Sri Lanka in Taunton during the 1999 World Cup, Dravid scores 145 out of a stand of 318 in 45 overs with Ganguly, which is the highest in any ODI. Dravid establishes himself as the pacemaker, reaching his second successive hundred at almost a run a ball.
</dd>
        <dt>November 8, 1999</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">History again</dd><dd>Against New Zealand, Dravid makes his highest ODI score and helps break the record he and Ganguly made in the World Cup. Dravid, with a run-a-ball 153, partners Tendulkar and the pair adds 331 in 46 overs as India post their then-highest total of 376 for 2.
</dd>
        <dt>March 11-15, 2001
        <dd id="cursdd">The match</dd><dd>No Indian fan can ever forget Kolkata in 2001. Dismissed by Shane Warne twice in three innings and demoted to No.6, Dravid has a point to prove. In the second innings, he joins VVS Laxman, with India still needing 42 runs to avoid an innings defeat, and lifts India from ignominy to incredible triumph. Warne is creamed for 41 runs in 51 balls.</dt>
</dd>
        <dt>October 16-20, 2003</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">First taste of captaincy</dd><dd>Against New Zealand in Mohali, Dravid stands in for the indisposed Ganguly. In the drawn first Test, he compiles a mammoth 222 but, in the second, fails with the bat (1 and 5) and generally has a nightmarish Test as a captain. Despite centuries from Laxman and Sehwag, India are forced to follow-on after four top-order centuries see New Zealand run away to 630. However, India manage to draw the game.</dd>
        <dt>December 17-21, 2004</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">First man in history</dd><dd>A 160 against Bangladesh in Chittagong, 2004 gives him a unique record - he is the first player to score centuries in all Test-playing countries. </dd>
        <dt>November 22, 2005</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">And... here comes the captain</dd><dd>After a dramatic period involving leaked emails and public spats, Dravid is appointed as the captain for the Test series against Sri Lanka.</dd>
        <dt>February 14, 2007</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">10,000 ODI runs</dd><dd>With a drive to long-on for a single, Dravid becomes only the sixth player to get to 10,000 runs in ODIs.</dd>
        <dt>July-August, 2007</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">An Indian summer</dd><dd>Under Dravid, India tour England and win their first Test series in England since 1986, albeit 1-0. Just one fifty in six innings is average by any standards, more so if your standards are as high Dravid's. But as captain he is blessed with luck: winning the toss in two of the three Tests, one of which produces a decisive result.</dt>
</dd>
        <dt>September 14, 2007</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">Dravid resigns as captain</dd><dd>In a letter written to the Indian board, Dravid asks to be relieved of the captaincy before Australia's tour later in the month.</dd>
        <dt>October 27, 2007</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">Dropped from ODIs</dd><dd>Dravid is left out of the squad to face Pakistan in a five-match series. His ODI career appears over.
</dd>
        <dt>December 20, 2008</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">Happy to be contributing again</dd><dd>Dravid ends a wretched 2008 with his 26th Test century, a dogged, stonewalling effort against England in Mohali.
</dd>
        <dt>August 16, 2009</dt>
        <dd id="cursdd">A call for help</dd><dd>In response to India's woes against short-pitched bowling in the summer of 2009, the selectors recall Dravid after nearly two years for a tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy. He is dropped less than a month later.
</dd>

      <dt>July-August 2011</dt>
      <dd id="cursdd">Back at his best</dd><dd>Standing tall amid a 4-0 drubbing in England, Dravid scores three centuries in a series in which no other Indian manages even one. Two of those hundreds are as openers, and in the fourth Test at The Oval he becomes only the third Indian to carry his bat, scoring an unbeaten 146 out of 300.
</dd>
      <dt>Dec11-Jan12</dt>
      <dd id="cursdd">Disappointment in Australia</dd><dd>In eight innings in Australia, Dravid manages only 194 runs at an average of 24.25. It's to be his last Test series.</dd>
      <dt>March 9, 2012</dt>
      <dd id="cursdd">End of an era</dd><dd>Dravid announces his retirement from all international and first-class cricket.</dd>
